Task Description
----------------

This file describes the data for the "Hack the News Datathon".
See its website for more detail:

	https://www.datasciencesociety.net/datathon/
	https://www.datasciencesociety.net/hack-news-datathon-case-propaganda-detection/

The datathon is about detecting the use of propaganda in news articles. 
It features three tasks:

Task 1: Propaganda detection at the article level (PAL). 
	This is a classical supervised document classification problem. 
You are given a set of news articles, and you have to classify each article as
“propagandistic article” vs. “non-propagandistic article.”

Task 2: Propaganda detection at the sentence level (PSL). 
	This is another classification task, but of different granularity. 
The objective is to classify each sentence in a news article as either
“any propaganda technique is used in the sentence” or 
“the sentence contains no propaganda.”

Task 3: Propaganda type recognition (PTR). 
	This task is similar to the task of Named Entity Recognition,
but applied in the propaganda detection setting.
The goal is to detect the occurrences of propagandistic techniques in the text
and to correctly assign a type of propaganda to each text fragment.
The inventory of possible techniques is described here:

File Format
-----------

- Input File Format

	- Task 1: 3-column TAB-separated format: 
		1) the first column contains the title and the contents of the article
			(the newlines in the original article have been replace with two spaces); 
		2) the second column is the article id; 
		3) the third column is the label of the article. Possible values are 
			"propaganda", "non-propaganda" and "?" (the question mark 
			replaces the labels in the development and test sets)

	- Task 2: one file per news article. Each file contains the title and 
		the content of the article, split by sentences (one row per sentence). 
		The sentence splitting is performed automatically using the NLTK package.

	- Task 3: the same set of articles for task 2 is used as input for task 3.


- Output File Format	

	- Task 1: a 2-column TAB-separated file with the following format

		<article id>	<label>

		where the article ID is the value in the second column of the 
		corresponding input file, label={propaganda, non-propaganda}
		Here is an example row of the output file:

			727600136	non-propaganda

	- Task 2: a 3-column TAB-separated file with the following format

		<article id>	<sentence id>	<label>

		where the article ID can be found in the input file name, 
		the sentence ID for the i-th sentence is i (the first sentence has id 1),
		and label={propaganda, non-propaganda}
		One example row of the output file, related to the input file 
		"article755393220.txt" is the following:

		755393220	1	propaganda

		For each article, we provide a file with a template of the output 
		format related to that article. For example, the predictions related 
		to article755393220.txt should appear in article755393220.task2.labels.
		We also provide two files as a template for a submission:
		"dev.task2.labels.template", "test.task2.labels.template".
		To make a submission, it is enough to replace the "?" in these two files
		with a predicted label: "propaganda" or "non-propaganda".
	
	- Task 3: a 4-column TAB-separated file with the following format

		<article id>	<propaganda technique name>	<fragment start position>	<fragment end position>

		where the article ID can be found in the input file name, the
		name of the propaganda technique is one of the strings in the file
		task2-3/propaganda-techniques-names.txt,
		the fragment start position is the index of the first character of the fragment
		(the first character in the input file has index 0),
		while the fragment end position is the ending character of the fragment.
		A span [1,3] means that the fragment refers to the 2nd (because counting from 0), 
		and the 3rd characters (only two characters, as the last index is excluded)
		of the input file. E.g., [1,3] would refer to the string "el" in the string "Hello".
		Another example: if the file starts with "You are such a baby!",
		the interval [15,19] would refer to "baby".
		Here is an example row of the output file, for input file "article755393220.txt":

		755393220	Loaded_Language	1726	1731	

		Notice that, if for the same article id, the output file has at least two overlapping 
		fragments flagged with the same propaganda technique, our scoring system will not 
		accept it.

Folder Content Description
--------------------------

- "task1" contains the data related to Task 1

	- task1.train.txt: training set for Task 1 
	- task1.dev.txt: development set for Task 1
	- task1.test.txt: test set for Task 1
	The format of these files is described above in section 
	'File Format' -> 'Input File Format' -> 'Task 1'

- "task2-3" contains the the data related to Tasks 2 and 3

	- propaganda-techniques-names.txt: it contains the strings that identify 
		the propaganda techniques. When writing prediction for Task 3, 
		the exact strings listed in this file have to be used.

	- train: folder containing the training set for Tasks 2 and 3. 
		Each file whose name ends in "*.txt" in that folder 
                contains the title and content of one article.
                The format of these files is described above in section
        		'File Format' -> 'Input File Format' -> 'Task 2'.
		Each file ending in "*.task2.labels" contains the predictions 
		for Task 2 for the corresponding article. 
		Each file ending in "*.task3.labels" contains the predictions for Task 3	
		for the corresponding article.

	- dev: folder containing the development set for Tasks 2 and 3. Each "*.txt" 
		file has the same format as the training set
		(see 'File Format' -> 'Input File Format' -> 'Task 2').
		Each file ending in "*.task2.labels" is the template of the prediction 
		for that single article (where the labels "propaganda", "non-propaganda"
		are replaced with "?").  

	- test: folder containing the test set for Tasks 2 and 3. Each "*.txt" file has 
		the same format as the training set
			(see 'File Format' -> 'Input File Format' -> 'Task 2'). 
			Each file ending in "*.task2.labels" is the template 
			for the prediction for that single article 
			(where the labels "propaganda", "non-propaganda" are replaced with "?"). 

	- dev.task2.labels.template: a sample prediction file for Task 2 for the whole 
					development set in which the sentence labels are 
					replaced with "?"  

	- test.task2.labels.template: a sample prediction file for Task 2 for the whole
					development set in which the sentence labels are
					replaced with "?"
